#### **Problem Statement:**
> *To classify the given email or SMS message as spam or ham using the relevant dataset and compare the two machine learning algorithms i.e. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm for the same.*

#### **Introduction:**
This project aims to demonstarate the classify the given email or SMS message as ham or spam. This is achieved by using the KNN and MNB algorithm. Various pre-processing and optimisation techniques are implemented to achieve the desired results.
#### **Data Source:**
 The data source for the model has been taken from _Kaggle_. It is raw data which is processed in the code given below to fit the model. The dataset used to predict spam Emails and spam SMS using the ML algorithms are below:

*  Spam Emails Dataset: It contains the text of `50379 email` messages and a label, classifying the message as "spam" or "ham". It has 29% of messages as spam while 71% of the messages are ham [Dataset: spam_ham_dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/spam-mails-dataset) 
*  Spam SMS Dataset: It contains the text of `5572 SMS` messages and a label, classifying the message as "spam" or "ham". It has 13% of messages as spam while 87% of the messages are ham [Dataset: spam.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
